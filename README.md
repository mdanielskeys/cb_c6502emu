# 6502 Emulator in C
## Yet Another 6502 Emulator
Did the world need another 6502 emulator? No, probably not. I am doing this project to educate myself and get reacquainted with C. I was definitely educated by oneLoneCoder's *[NES project](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES)*. His *[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nViZg02IMQo&list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf)* are a great series. They gave me a great start and some cool code organization ideas. 
## What's Next
As of 2/18/2024, I am still working on this project. My plans are as follows:
- Finish the implementation of BCD for SBC.
- Write a better program input mechanism for the testing engine.
- Test against better test suites and make adjustments as necessary.
- Build my own fictional computer that runs against the 6502 emulator, complete with a display and and user interaction.
## What's With the CB Prefix
Much like oneLoneCoder prefixes his source files with olc, I decided to add my own prefix. CB is short for CrunchBerry. That is the gamer tag I use for StarCraft and other online games when it is available. I feel that it is silly, but silly is how I roll.
## Message
I hope this code can help you if that is what you need. I also encourage you to submit any fixes or bugs you run up against. As I said, this is just a hobby, and I am trying to learn these things again. I expect things are not perfect; they never are. I encourage you to add your own stamp to the project through a fork or pull request.
